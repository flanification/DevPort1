<h2>Multimedia Artist | Web Designer/Developer | Photographer</h2>

<div class="about">
	<p class="bio"> Passionate with design, codes, programs and videos. You can easily identify an
	introvert from an extrovert.Took up Information Technology way back at College, but didn't excel at coding. So design took place. A few years gone by, inspiration and motivation knocks on my door. This time, I'm ready to take the rightful place that I should had since then.</p>
